	<h1>About Jeanmarie Jackman</h1>
<p>"I'm still evolving" [<em>Wm. Hurt</em>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085244/">The Big Chill</a>, 1983]</p><p>I'm a human being, a work-in-progress, who happens, at present, to be employed as a Legal Assistant.  For the moment, I am living on Long Island.<p></p>I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development at General Assembly, as a way to review and refresh previously learned/forgotten web design skills and to progress forward learning new, more current techniques and tools.  I am primarily interested in Game Design, and this is my "jumping off" point, as well as a means with which to self-promote.</p>
<br>
	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a User Experience Designer with <a href="http://www.Blizzard.com">Blizzard Entertainment</a> because I'd like to work in a company which values collaboration, cooperation and community and whose games are evolutionary and ground-breaking.</p>
