	<h1>Design Challenge</h1>

	<h2>Which Two Websites Inspire You?</h2>
	<p>The two websites I selected are <a href="http://my.specialk.com/en_US/step2challenge.html/">My Special K</a> and <a href="http://www.davidshaver.net">David Shaver, Game Designer</a></p>
	<br>
	<h2>How do they use space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>I felt the <a href="http://my.specialk.com/en_US/step2challenge.html/">My Special K</a> website was effective in funneling a person through the process, engaging them and committing them to completing the enrollment, via it's simple, clear layout. The use of white space reminded me very much of the revolutionary VW ads back in the late 1950s, I think, but you get the ide. The clickable tiles with simple yet attractive graphics, makes the user feel calm, not distracted, and able to complete the process quickly -- quickly is important. And the use of one full page per idea makes it feel simple and, therefore, not stressful, complicated or time consuming.

		The other website, <a href="http://www.davidshaver.net">David Shaver, Game Designer</a>, makes it attractive and easy to get a great sense of the designer's area of expertise and level of accomplishment by its layout. And the heirarchical size/placement of the graphic links on the first page, prioritize the work clearly for the viewer, at a glance.</p>
	
	<br>
	<h2>Compare/Constrast</h2>
<p>The Special K website had each page for a single purpose, and visuals basically all "above the fold." It engaged you to move through the process in a linear, directed way.  Whereas, David Shaver employs a vertical direction, that brings you down below the fold, section by section, and encourages you to explore in your own fashion - self-directed.</p>
